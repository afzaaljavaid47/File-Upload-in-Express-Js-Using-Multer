# File Upload in Express JS Using Multer

## Abstract

This project demonstrates how to implement file upload functionality in an Express JS application using Multer. Multer is a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files. The project provides a clear and maintainable solution for handling file uploads, storing them on the server, and managing uploaded files efficiently.

## Introduction

File uploading is a common feature in web applications, allowing users to upload images, documents, and other files. This project is designed to illustrate the practical implementation of file upload functionality in an Express JS application using Multer. The application includes examples of setting up Multer, configuring storage options, handling file uploads through routes, and managing uploaded files on the server. This project highlights essential server-side development practices, such as routing, middleware usage, and file handling.

### Features

- Demonstrates the setup and usage of Multer for file uploads in an Express JS application.
- Provides configurable storage options for managing uploaded files.
- Implements routes for handling file upload requests.
- Includes examples of single and multiple file uploads.
- Showcases error handling for file upload operations.

## Tools and Techniques

This project utilizes several tools and techniques to implement robust and efficient file upload functionality:

- **Express JS**: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side development.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side execution of JavaScript.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` and file uploads.
- **File System Module (fs)**: A Node.js module for interacting with the file system.
- **Path Module**: A Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A templating engine for generating HTML markup with JavaScript.
- **CSS**: For styling the application interface.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: Tools for maintaining code quality and formatting.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform.

By combining these tools and techniques, the File Upload in Express JS Using Multer project provides a comprehensive and practical approach to handling file uploads in server-side applications.
